    "EmulAI comes loaded with a Super Mario 64 ROM and a slick settings menu where you can tweak controls, audio, and fire up plug-ins like Rediscovered, Personalizer, Other Games, Wonder Graphics, and Debugger for maximum chaos.",
    "Its ROM menu lets you dive into ROMs, fuck around with save-states, reset shit, or hit the 'ROM catalogue' to snag a bunch of Nintendo 64 game ROMs and some wild ROM hacks, no questions asked.",
    "Every game in the catalogue—except those pesky ROM hacks—has built-in cheats to screw with gameplay, plus a dope loading screen to hype you up when shit’s booting.",
    "The Rediscovered plug-in digs up hidden ROM crap and slaps polished versions into the game, while Personalizer’s AI, always on for Mario 64, makes it feel like the game’s stalking you in the best way.",
    "Other plug-ins juice up graphics to eye-melting levels, let you play random non-N64 games that might look like N64 classics, or throw up a debug menu for when you wanna break everything."
